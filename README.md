# Hearts of Iron IV Map Editor

Personal and regrettably abandoned project. An application made in Java Swing. My objective was to create a desktop application that allows users to load data from HOI4 files and easily modify maps for modding through a user-friendly interface.

## Functionalities

In its current state, the application allows user to:
- Load data from HOI4 files (both vanilla and modded) by choosing file paths in a file explorer and generate country, state and province maps.
- Zoom in and out, as well as move viewed image (one of the 3 maps).
- Track cursor coordinates on the image.
- Draw on an image with a simple 1px cyan brush.

## Problems

As I mentioned, the project is abandoned, so many bugs and issues are to be expected. For example:
- **!!!  When user loads files multiple times during a single session, memory leak occurs. (The data structures generated by the program should be monitored more thoroughly.)**
- Brush tool *is too slow* - when used over wide area, it leaves many gaps. (Probably should be done concurrently or at least generate lines between drawn points.)
- Zooming in/out while moving the image results in an unnatural behavior.
- The program was tested only on Windows 10.
- UI is unpolished.
- The code may be slightly loose. There are too few comments, no documentation and some attributes/methods can be useless at this stage of the application.
